## Google Trends Data Science Project
This GitHub repository contains a data science project that explores the relationship between Google Trends search volume and various other data sources such as the price of Bitcoin, the stock price of Tesla, and the unemployment rate. The project aims to identify potential patterns or correlations between search popularity and these different variables.

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to analyze the search volume data obtained from Google Trends and investigate whether it correlates with other datasets. The repository includes code, data files, and documentation related to the project.

The main research questions that this project aims to answer are as follows:

- Does the search volume for specific keywords on Google Trends have any relationship with the price of Bitcoin?
- Is there a correlation between the search volume for specific keywords on Google Trends and the stock price of Tesla?
- Can the search volume for the term "Unemployment Benefits" provide insights into the actual unemployment rate?
## Data Sources
The following data sources have been used for this project:

- Unemployment Rate from FRED: This dataset provides the historical unemployment rate. The data is obtained from FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) and is used to analyze the relationship between the search volume for "Unemployment Benefits" on Google Trends and the actual unemployment rate.

- Google Trends: Google Trends provides search volume data based on the popularity of specific keywords or search terms over time. This dataset is used to analyze the relationship between search volume and other variables like the price of Bitcoin and Tesla's stock price.

- Yahoo Finance for Tesla Stock Price: The stock price data for Tesla is obtained from Yahoo Finance. It is used to explore any potential correlations between the search volume on Google Trends and Tesla's stock price.

- Yahoo Finance for Bitcoin Stock Price: The stock price data for Bitcoin is obtained from Yahoo Finance. It is used to investigate if there are any connections between the search volume on Google Trends and the price of Bitcoin.


- The data directory contains the various data files used in the project, including the unemployment rate data, Google Trends data, Tesla stock price data, and Bitcoin stock price data.
